## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains **two NumPy-powered mini-projects** that demonstrate efficient data processing, broadcasting, and statistical analysis:

1. **Client Sales Data Analysis** - Automates statistical calculations on mock client sales data.
2. **NumPy Discount Calculation** - Applies dynamic discount rates to a fictional customer dataset using **NumPy broadcasting**.

These projects utilize **NumPy, Pandas, and Python** to efficiently manipulate data and automate numerical analysis tasks.

## ðŸ›’ Client Sales Data Analysis
This mini-project automates the calculation and statistical analysis of mock client sales data using **NumPy**. It processes daily sales records for multiple clients, computing essential metrics like **total sales, average sales, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values**. The final structured summary is displayed in a **Pandas DataFrame** and saved as a CSV file.

### âœ¨ Key Features
âœ… Generates mock **2D NumPy arrays** representing client sales data over a week.  
âœ… Performs statistical operations, including:
   - **Total sales per client**
   - **Average daily sales**
   - **Standard deviation of sales**
   - **Maximum and minimum sales recorded**  
âœ… Normalizes sales data for easier comparison.  
âœ… Saves the processed results into a structured CSV file (`sales_summary.csv`).  

### ðŸ“Š Sample Output

| Client ID | Total Sales | Average Sales | Std Dev | Max Sale | Min Sale |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1001     |   $5,230    |   $747       |  $98   | $920   | $590   |
| 1002     |   $4,890    |   $698       |  $102  | $870   | $530   |

## ðŸ’° NumPy Discount Calculation Script
This script simulates a **customer discount calculation system** using NumPy **broadcasting** to apply different discount rates based on purchase amounts.

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works
- Categorizes customers into **low, mid, and high spenders**.
- Applies **appropriate discount rates** using NumPy broadcasting.
- Computes final prices **without using loops**.
- Saves the structured results into a **Pandas DataFrame** and exports them to `discounted_customers.csv`.

### ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters
Using NumPy broadcasting for element-wise operations **removes the need for loops**, making the calculations much more efficient compared to traditional approaches.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
1. **NumPy is powerful for numerical analysis** â€“ it significantly speeds up array operations compared to Python lists.  
2. **Vectorized calculations and broadcasting** help perform arithmetic operations efficiently across arrays of different shapes.  
3. **Combining NumPy with Pandas** makes it easy to structure, analyze, and export data for real-world applications.  
4. **NumPy broadcasting simplifies element-wise operations** without explicit iteration, optimizing performance.  
5. **Git Branching & Merging** â€“ I practiced creating feature branches, resolving merge conflicts, and structuring commits properly.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
ðŸ”¹ Apply similar analysis to **real-world datasets**.  
ðŸ”¹ Explore **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to visualize sales trends.  
ðŸ”¹ Implement an **automated reporting system** that generates weekly insights.  
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with **machine learning** by using NumPy-powered regression models.
