# NumPy Mini-Project: Client Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini-project automates the calculation and statistical analysis of mock client sales data using **NumPy**. It processes daily sales records for multiple clients, computing essential metrics like **total sales, average sales, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values**. The final structured summary is displayed in a **Pandas DataFrame** and saved as a CSV file for further analysis.

## ✨ Key Features
✅ Generates mock **2D NumPy arrays** representing client sales data over a week.  
✅ Performs statistical operations, including:
   - **Total sales per client**
   - **Average daily sales**
   - **Standard deviation of sales**
   - **Maximum and minimum sales recorded**  
✅ Normalizes sales data for easier comparison.  
✅ Saves the processed results into a structured CSV file (`sales_summary.csv`).  

## 📚 What I Learned
1. **NumPy is powerful for numerical analysis** – it significantly speeds up array operations compared to Python lists.  
2. **Vectorized calculations and broadcasting** help perform arithmetic operations efficiently across arrays of different shapes.  
3. **Combining NumPy with Pandas** makes it easy to structure, analyze, and export data for real-world applications.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
🔹 Apply similar analysis to **real-world datasets**.  
🔹 Explore **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for visualizing statistical results.  
🔹 Automate larger-scale data analysis by integrating **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.
