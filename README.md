Day 1: Python Basics ðŸš€

Learning Path & Results

Today, I kickstarted my Python learning journey, focusing on foundational concepts and hands-on practice.

âœ… What I Accomplished:
 - Installed Python and set up VS Code as my coding environment.
 - Completed Codecademy Python lessons 1-6, covering:
    - Print statements, variables, data types, and mathematical operations.
    - Conditionals (if-elif-else), logical operators, and loops (for, while).
 - Practiced Python fundamentals through 3 Exercism lessons and 5 loop-based exercises.
 - Wrote and debugged 5 custom Python scripts to reinforce my understanding.
 - Created a GitHub repository and uploaded my first functional script:
    - client_inventory.py â€“ A nested dictionary-based inventory system using functions, loops, and conditionals.
 - Ensured PEP-8 compliance, added clear inline comments, and pushed my work to GitHub.

ðŸ”¥ Next Steps:
 - Continue practicing with real-world Python exercises.
 - Dive deeper into functions, data structures, and file handling.

ðŸš€ Onward to mastering Python!
